    "PyTorch was released in early 2017 and has been making a pretty big impact in the deep learning community. It's developed as an open source project by the Facebook AI Research team, but is being adopted by teams everywhere in industry and academia. In my experience, it's the best framework for learning deep learning and just a delight to work with in general."
