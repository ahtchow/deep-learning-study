    "## Gradient Descent with Squared Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Make predictions as close as possible to the real values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure, we use a metric of how wrong the predictions are using \"error.\" A common metric is the sum of the squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "![a](Images/a1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- where y_hat is the prediction and y is thre true value.\n",
    "- you take the sum over all output units j and another sum over all data points μ\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This variable j represents the output units of the network. For each output unit, find the difference between the true value yy and the predicted value from the network y_hat, then square the difference, then sum up all those squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- μ is a sum over all the data points. So, for each data point you calculate the inner sum of the squared differences for each output unit. Then you sum up those squared differences for each data point. That gives you the overall error for all the output predictions for all the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Squared Errors (SSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The square ensures the error is always positive, so we only consider magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the output of a neural network, the prediction, depends on weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "![a](Images/a2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goals is find the weights W_ij that minimize the squared error E. To do this with a neural network we need ***gradient descent***\n",
    "\n",
    "We must take small steps everytime to minimize the error. We can find this direction by calculating the gradient of the squared error. Gradient is another term for rate of change or slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient is just a derivative generalized to functions with more than one variable. We can use calculus to find the gradient at any point in our error function, which depends on the input weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I've plotted an example of the error of a neural network with two inputs, and accordingly, two weights. You can read this like a topographical map where points on a contour line have the same error and darker contour lines correspond to larger errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, you calculate the error and the gradient, then use those to determine how much to change each weight. Repeating this process will eventually find weights that are close to the minimum of the error function, the black dot in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "![a](Images/a3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveats / Local Mins\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the weights will just go wherever the gradient takes them, they can end up where the error is low, but not the lowest. These spots are called local minima. If the weights are initialized with the wrong values, gradient descent could lead the weights into a local minimum, illustrated below. There are methods to avoid this, such as using [momentum](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/).\n",

    "![a](Images/a4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Math Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need some measure of how bad our prediction are. Just use the difference in output $E = (y - \\hat{y})$. We can also add a square to remove negatives and penalize outliers more, so $E = (y - \\hat{y})^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to sum up the error for all data records denoted by the sum over μ. Also multiply 1/2 to clean up math later.\n",
    "\n",
    "$E = (1/2) \\sum_{μ}(y - \\hat{y})^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next sub in the prediction as a function of weights \n",

    "So for a single output: \n",
    "\n",
    "![a](Images/a6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we find the negative for the gradient, which points to the weights with lowest error.\n",

This dataset has three input features: GRE score, GPA, and the rank of the undergraduate school (numbered 1 through 4). Institutions with rank 1 have the highest prestige, those with rank 4 have the lowest.\n",

    "# Data Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think there will be three input units, but we actually need to transform the data first. The rank feature is categorical, the numbers don't encode any sort of relative values. Rank 2 is not twice as much as rank 1, rank 3 is not 1.5 more than rank 2. Instead, we need to use dummy variables to encode rank, splitting the data into four new columns encoded with ones or zeros. Rows with rank 1 have one in the rank 1 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. Rows with rank 2 have one in the rank 2 dummy column, and zeros in all other columns. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also need to standardize the GRE and GPA data, which means to scale the values such that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1. This is necessary because the sigmoid function squashes really small and really large inputs. The gradient of really small and large inputs is zero, which means that the gradient descent step will go to zero too. Since the GRE and GPA values are fairly large, we have to be really careful about how we initialize the weights or the gradient descent steps will die off and the network won't train. Instead, if we standardize the data, we can initialize the weights easily and everyone is happy.\n",
