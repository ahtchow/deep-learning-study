    "- Autoregressive Models: Generate Images Pixel by Pixel (Used in 1990s)\n",
    "- GAN generate entire images at a go.\n",
    "- The genrative model is unsupervised, there are no labels.\n",

    "- GAN use a neural network with a differentiable function as a generative model\n",
    "- Generator Network takes random noise (image) as input and tries to reshape to a reconizable image\n",
    "- The generator network ouputs a realistic image.\n",
    "- Many different random noises as inputs result in various realistic output images\n",
    "- Goal is to find images similar to real data by making more images from similar probability distribution\n",
    "- We get the model to do this by adjusting parameters\n",
    "- Hard to compute the probability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A second network called the discriminator learns to guide the generator\n",
    "- the discriminator is just a regular net classifier trained on fake and real data\n",
    "- where the discriminator output the probability that the output is real.\n",
    "- The generator is trained (tuning parameters) to output real\n",
    "- Overtime the probability distribution for the images are mapped to the area with highest success rate\n",

    "\n",
    "- Adverserial refers to the competition between the generator and discriminator\n",
    "- Game theory used to model cooperation and conflict between agents\n",
    "- Each agent can choose from set of actions and each decision is associated with a well-defined payoff ( E.g we assume rock paper scissors are played randomly from both agents)\n",
    "- Therefore the equillibrium model of decision making is random\n",
    "- To understand GANs we need to understand how equillibria works in the context of machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"gan_img/a3.png\" alt=\"drawing\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- most machine learning models decisions are based of optimization of parameters (minimizing cost function)\n",
    "- GANs are different since there are generator and discriminator, which have their own respective cost functions.\n",
    "- The cost for the disceriminator is just the negative cost of the genreator\n",
    "- In other words we can use a value to measure the models image generation accuracy\n",
    "- The generator will minimize the value function, whereas the discriminator wants to maximize the value function\n",
