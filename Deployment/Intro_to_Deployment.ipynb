    "1. What's the machine learning workflow?\n",

    "\n",

    "2. How does deployment fit into the machine learning workflow?\n",

    "### What is Cloud Computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud computing can simply be thought of as transforming an Information Technology (IT) product into a service. With our vacation photos example, we transformed storing photos on an IT product, the flash drive; into storing them using a service, like Google Drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a cloud storage service provides the benefits of making it easier to access and share your vacation photos, because you no longer need the flash drive. You’ll only need a device with an internet connection to access your photos and to grant permission to others to access your photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, think of cloud computing as using an internet connected device to log into a cloud computing service, like Google Drive, to access an IT resource, your vacation photos. These IT resources, your vacation photos, are stored in the cloud provider’s data center. Besides cloud storage, other cloud services include: cloud applications, databases, virtual machines, and other services like SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would a business decide to use cloud computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the factors related to choosing cloud computing services, instead of developing on-premise IT resources are related to time and cost. The capacity utilization graph below shows how cloud computing compares to traditional infrastructure (on-premise IT resources) in meeting customer demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capacity in the graph below can be thought of as the IT resources like: compute capacity, storage, and networking, that's needed to meet customer demand for a business' products and the costs associated with those IT resources. In our vacation photos example, customer demand is for storing and sharing customer photos. The IT resources are the required software and hardware that enables photo storage and sharing in the cloud or on-premise (traditional infrastructure).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the graph, notice that traditional infrastructure doesn't scale when there are spikes in demand, and also leaves excess when preparing for future demand. This ability to easily meet unstable, fluctuating customer demand illustrates many of the benefits of cloud computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "1. Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs (providing cost reduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased Scalability (providing simplified capacity planning)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Increased Availability and Reliability (providing organizational agility)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Risks:\n",
    "1. (Potential) Increase in Security Vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reduced Operational Governance Control (over cloud resources)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multi-regional Compliance and Legal Issues\n",

    "# Machine Learning Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "All algorithms used within the machine learning workflow are similar for both the cloud and on-premise computing. The only real difference may be in the user interface and libraries that will be used to execute the machine learning workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For personal use, one’s likely to use cloud services, if they don’t have enough computing capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "With academic use, quite often one will use the university’s on-premise computing resources, given their availability. For smaller universities or research groups with few funding resources, cloud services might offer a viable alternative to university computing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For workplace usage, the amount of cloud resources used depends upon an organization’s existing infrastructure and their vulnerability to the risks of cloud computing. A workplace may have security concerns, operational governance concerns, and/or compliance and legal concerns regarding cloud usage. Additionally, a workplace may already have on-premise infrastructure that supports the workflow; therefore, making cloud usage an unnecessary expenditure. Keep in mind, many progressive companies may be incorporating cloud computing into their business due to the business drivers and benefits of cloud computing."
