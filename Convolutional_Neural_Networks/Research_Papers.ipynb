    "\n",
    "- 2012, Developed at University of Toronto using best GPU at that time.\n",
    "- Pioneered the use of the ReLU activation function and dropout as a technique for avoiding overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Created by Microsoft.\n",
    "- Similar to VGG, such that the same structure is repeated again and again for layers.\n",
    "- Largest Version: 152 Layers\n",
    "- Discovered Problem: As the layers increased, at some point there was an issue called ***Vanishing Gradient*** in which the gradient signals get weakend in backpropagation due to the depth.\n",
    "- Solution: Add connections to allow gradients to skip layers to backpropagate faster.\n",
